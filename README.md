# Asl-to-Speech

Asl-to-Speech is a wearable technology that translates American Sign Language (ASL) into speech. The goal of this project is to help people to facilitate communication using sign language.

## How it works

The [Leap Motion Controller](https://www.leapmotion.com/) uses infrared cameras to track the movement of your hands and fingers.

This project uses Nuance's Text-to-Speech (tts) API to translate the motion into speech.
